/**
 * \brief  This function writes data from a specified buffer onto the
 *         transmitter FIFO of UART.
 *
 * \param  pTxBuffer        Pointer to a buffer in the transmitter.  
 * \param  numBytesToWrite  Number of bytes to be transmitted to the 
 *                          transmitter FIFO. The user has the freedom to not 
 *                          specify any valid value for this if he wants to
 *                          print until the occurence of a NULL character.
 *                          In this case, he has to pass a negative value as
 *                          this parameter. 
 *  
 * \return  Number of bytes written to the transmitter FIFO.
 *
 * \note   1> Whenever a null character(\0) is encountered in the 
 *            data to be transmitted, the transmission is stopped. \n
 *         2> Whenever the transmitter data has a new line character(\n), 
 *            it is interpreted as a new line(\n) + carraige return(\r)
 *            characters. This is because the serial console interprets a 
 *            new line character as it is and does not introduce a carraige 
 *            return. \n
 *            
 *         Some example function calls of this function are: \n
 *
 *         UARTPuts(txArray, -2): This shall print the contents of txArray[]
 *         until the occurence of a NULL character. \n
 *
 *         UARTPuts("Hello World", 8): This shall print the first 8 characters
 *         of the string shown. \n
 *
 *         UARTPuts("Hello World", 20): This shall print the string shown until
 *         the occurence of the NULL character. Here, the NULL character is
 *         encountered earlier than the length of 20 bytes.\n

 * \param pcString is the format string.
 * \param ... are the optional arguments, which depend on the contents of the
 * format string.
 *
 * This function is very similar to the C library <tt>fprintf()</tt> function.
 * All of its output will be sent to the UART.  Only the following formatting
 * characters are supported:
 *
 * - \%c to print a character
 * - \%d to print a decimal value
 * - \%s to print a string
 * - \%u to print an unsigned decimal value
 * - \%x to print a hexadecimal value using lower case letters
 * - \%X to print a hexadecimal value using lower case letters (not upper case
 * letters as would typically be used)
 * - \%p to print a pointer as a hexadecimal value
 * - \%\% to print out a \% character
 *
 * For \%s, \%d, \%u, \%p, \%x, and \%X, an optional number may reside
 * between the \% and the format character, which specifies the minimum number
 * of characters to use for that value; if preceded by a 0 then the extra
 * characters will be filled with zeros instead of spaces.  For example,
 * ``\%8d'' will use eight characters to print the decimal value with spaces
 * added to reach eight; ``\%08d'' will use eight characters as well but will
 * add zeroes instead of spaces.
 *
 * The type of the arguments after \e pcString must match the requirements of
 * the format string.  For example, if an integer was passed where a string
 * was expected, an error of some kind will most likely occur.
 *
 * \return None.
